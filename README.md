### RTSP server with authentication for testing purposes

## Dependencies

* `docker`

## Examples of use

To create a simple test stream, just launch the following command: 
`docker run -p 8554:8554 ullaakut/CES`

You can now access it on the URL `rtsp://0.0.0.0:8554/live.sdp`.

To create a test stream with credentials, just add the RTSP_PASSWORD and RTSP_USERNAME arguments like so:

`docker run -p 8554:8554 -e RTSP_PASSWORD=mypass -e RTSP_USERNAME=myusername`

You can now access it on the URL `rtsp://myusername:mypass@0.0.0.0:8554/live.sdp`.

### Usage

```
docker run \
       [-e RTSP_LISTEN_ADDRESS=your_listen_address] \
       [-e RTSP_PORT=your_port] -p your_port:your_port \
       [-e RTSP_PATH=your_path] \
       [-e RTSP_INPUT_FILE=your_input_file] \
       [-e RTSP_USERNAME=your_username] \
       [-e RTSP_PASSWORD=your_password] \
       [-e RTSP_RESOLUTION='your_width'x'your_height'] \
       [-e RTSP_FRAMERATE=your_framerate] \
